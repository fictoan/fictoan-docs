                        Fictoan stems from the idea that true hand-off between the designer and developer must be in
                        code, rather than a set of static images or art-boards.

                    <Text size="huge" marginBottom="micro">
                        The designer should be in complete control of the interface and the experience, rather than the
                        developer trying to interpret the designer‚Äôs intentions via a document.
                    </Text>

                    <Text size="huge" marginBottom="micro">
                        That way, the designer can focus on usability, accessibility, and aesthetics, while the
                        developer can focus on performance, scalability, and maintainability.

                    <Text size="huge" marginBottom="micro">
                        The goal must be to build and ship, and not bicker whose job it is to fix UI bugs. These things
                        are best left to the designer, so that the developer can spend their time on things like
                        performance and deployments.

                        same as passing off working code. We think this will remain true for quite some time, and in the
                        meanwhile, see how we can make the lives of a designer and a developer easier.

                        The other principle Fictoan is built around is simplicity and obviousness. This is best
                        reflected in the naming conventions and the prop nomenclature.

                        The idea is to remove the entry barriers for people dipping their toes into code for the
                        first time, especially for those from a design background. The easiest way to do this is to
                        simply keep everything in plain English, and not introduce complexities and conditional
                        hierarchies, that is most often the case with most other frameworks.
